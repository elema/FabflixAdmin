FabflixAdmin is a Java desktop GUI application built using Java Swing on the NetBeans IDE.

The application utilizes JDBC to interface with a MySQL database.

The goal of this project is to learn how to create a movie database, populate the database and build a program that connects to the database so that employees can manage movie information.

Fabflix employees can manage the movie database in the following ways:

- List movies featuring a given star.

- Insert a new movie into the database.

- Insert a new star into the database.

- Insert a new customer into the database.

- Delete a customer from the database.

- Provide the metadata of the database.

- Enter a valid SELECT/UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE SQL command.
